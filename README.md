# Annotorious ElasticSearch Plugin

A simple [Annotorious](https://github.com/annotorious/annotorious) plugin that stores annotations on an 
[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) server. This plugin is meant primarily for demo purposes, and
as an example for those interested in building their own storage plugins. I __strongly__ advise against using 
this plugin in any kind of production environment. (Contributions to make it production ready are always 
welcome though ;-)

This plugin is licensed under the [WTFPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL).

## Using this Plugin

Simply [download the script](https://raw.github.com/annotorious/annotorious-elasticsearch-plugin/master/anno-elasticsearch-plugin.js),
copy it to your server/Webspace and set it up with your page as described below.

1. The plugin uses jQuery. Therefore you need to import jQuery before importing the plugin script.
2. Add the plugin script to your page just like any other Annotorious plugin. Make sure the plugin script is
   loaded __after__ the main Annotorious script.
3. Attach the plugin to Annotorious using the ``anno.addPlugin`` API method.
4. Specify the base URL of the ElasticSearch server using a ``base_url`` config param.

## Example

    ....
      <head>
        <!-- Import main Annotorious script and CSS -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://annotorious.github.com/latest/annotorious.css" type="text/css" />
        <script src="https://annotorious.github.com/latest/annotorious.min.js"></script>
        
        <!-- Import jQuery - the ElasticSearch plugin depends on it! -->
        <script src="jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script>
        
        <!-- Import the plugin script -->
        <script src="my-scripts/anno-elasticsearch-plugin.js"></script>
        
        <!-- Use Annotorious' JavaScript API to attach and activate the plugin -->
        <script>
          anno.addPlugin('ElasticSearch', { base_url: 'http://www.my-es-server.com/annotations/' });
        </script>
      <head>
    ....

## Hacking on this Plugin

There is a test page in this project at __/test/test.html__. Simply open this test page in your
browser and you're ready to go.

A word of caution: the test page points to my dev ElasticSearch server. Feel free to use that 
to hack & test away. But be aware that I'm not making any guarantees in terms of uptime and availability.
Also, I'm occasionally flushing the server which means annotations will be lost without notice.
